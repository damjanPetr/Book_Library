Book Library

## Project Description

Vanilla JS SPA.

This is my foray into creating a functional Book Library Sistem with User Dashboard, Admin Dashboard and Login/Register system.

Currently the Auth login is just in testing version since it lives on the Front-End since it's not my primary focus. My main focus is making sure the JS SPA works accordingly to standars, and to figure out how to implement the best practices in traversing the DOM Tree, creating new Elements and structuring my code.

----------

The Backend is an emulation that works with direct fetching on a file instead of an URL, since the files live on the same server. The backend consists of standard CRUD Operations on Categories , Comments Users,Notes and Books.
